# Goto
# --------------------------
# This example shows how to use the goto statement
# to jump to a label in the code.
# Goto is only here for completeness and should not
# be used in real code. It is considered bad practice
# to use goto statements.

function main(): none
  decl i: int
  0 => i
  label a
    
  i 1 + => i
  i putint
  if i 10 < then
    goto a
  fi
end
