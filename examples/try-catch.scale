# Try-Catch
# --------------------------
# This example demonstrates the use of try-catch blocks to handle exceptions.
# The foo() function throws a TestException, which is caught by the catch block
# in foo(). The catch block in foo() re-throws the exception, which is caught
# by the catch block in main().

struct TestException : Exception
    function init(m: str): none
        m => self.msg
    end
end

function foo(): none
    try
        "Hello!" TestException::new throw
    
    # typeof specifies the type of exception to catch
    # as specifies the name of the exception variable, this is optional
    # if no name is specified, the name of the exception variable is 'exception'
    catch typeof TestException as e
        "Caught TestException: " e.msg + puts
        e throw
    done
end

function main(): none
    try
        foo
    catch typeof Exception
        "exception fell through to main()" puts
    done
end
