# Containers
# --------------------------
# Containers are a way to group related data together.
# Containers are a legacy feature and are not recommended for use.
# Instead, use a static struct.

container Foo
  decl bar: str
  decl baz: mut [str]
end

function main(): none
  "load/store" => Foo.bar
  Foo.bar puts
  
  8 any::new as [str] => Foo.baz
  "ref/deref" => @ Foo.baz
  Foo.baz @ puts
end
