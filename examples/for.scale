# For loop
# --------------------------
# This example shows how to use for loops

function main(): none
  # this will print the numbers from 1 to 9
  # lower bound inclusive, upper bound exclusive
  # the looping variable implicitly always has the
  # 'int' type
  for i in 1 to 10 do
    i puts
  done
end
